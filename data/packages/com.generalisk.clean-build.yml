description: >-
  Clean Build automatically gets rid of unnecessary debug files that are
  automatically generated during your Unity build.


  Examples of files that will be automatically deleted include:

  - Program Debug Files (PDBs) which often get automatically generated due to
  Managed Stripping among various other things

  - IL2CPP build files

  - Burst compiler reports
